# EPrints - Archivematica Integration

Digital Preservation through EPrints-Archivematica Integration - An EPrints export plugin for contents to be preserved with Archivematica

The EPrints-Archivematica integration proposal was first presented at Archivematica Camp and OR2018 in Bozeman.

# Summary

The following is a summary of the proposed workflow for EPrints-Archivematica integration:

* “Digital Preservation Export” batch script runs periodically that identifies new/updated items to
export and generates the exports in a directory structure optimized for [Archivematica transfers](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.7/user-manual/transfer/transfer/#transfer-checksums) described below.

* The export plugin will create a transfer for each eprint. Each transfer includes: 
	* An `objects` directory containing the uploaded digital files that are part of the eprint as well as any derivative access files generated by EPrints
	* An `objects/documents` folder containing all uploaded digital files that are a part of the eprint
	* A `objects/derivatives` folder containing any derivative access files that were generated by EPrints, such as thumbnail images, audio access files, video access files
	* A `metadata` folder with Dublin Core metadata (in JSON format), EPrints XML metadata, EPrints-generated "revision" XML files, and an `md5deep`-style checksum manifest for digital files in the `objects` directory
	* A `metadata/revisions` folder containing all EPrints-generated “revision” XML files

Transfers are moved to a specified shared storage location.

* The following would be the structure of the documents folder:

![Eprint Export Folder Structure - Documents](https://github.com/photomedia/EPrintsArchivematica/blob/master/eprint-export-documents-folder-structure.png)

* The following would be the structure of the derivatives folder:

`fileid-XXXXX -> folder# -> filename`

* Archivematica's [Automation Tools](https://github.com/artefactual/automation-tools) monitors shared storage for new bag, creates transfers/ingests in Archivematica according to a user-defined processing configuration, and then stores AIPs in archival storage.

This integration is currently in the technical specification phase.

# Implementation details

## Derivatives

$c->{DPExport}->{include_derivatives}=1;

Setting this to 0 would exclude anything such as thumbnail images and web accessible versions of the audio and video files.

## Checksum manifest

The `metadata/checksum.md5` file should follow the specifications detailed in the [Archivematica documentation for creating a transfer with existing checksums](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.8/user-manual/transfer/transfer/#create-a-transfer-with-existing-checksums).

Specifically, in this implementation, each line of the `checksum.md5` manifest should contain the md5 hash value for a file in the `objects` directory, followed by a space, followed by the relative path to the file from the `checksum.md5` file itself.

Example:

`2121dca88ad7f701d3f3e2d041004a56 ../objects/documents/my-doc.pdf`

For files with MD5 values already recorded in the EPrints database, use these values in the manifest.  For these values already recorded in EPrints database, they should be checked (ie., recalculated for the file and compared to what is stored in EPrints) signalling an error if there is a mismatch.  These errors indicate that file corruption may have already taken place.  There should be a configuration option to control what happens in case of a checksum mismatch:

$c->{DPExport}={on-checksum-mismatch}=skip-proceed|halt 

skip-proceed should be the default, meaning that the problematic eprint is flagged with an error in the eprint's digital preservation errors field, but the batch job continues.  If 'halt' is chosen, the entire batch job that the problematic eprint is a part of halts.

In addition, there should be an option to communicate checksum-mismatch error by email:

$c->{DPExport}={on-checksum-mismatch-email-notification}= 1|0

It should be set to 0 by default, and if set to 1, in addition to the problematic eprint not exporting, an email with the error information is sent to the address selected in the following config:

$c->{DPExport}={DP-admin-email}="[email address]"

For files with no MD5 value in the EPrints database:

* Generate a new MD5 from the file on disk
* Write the MD5 to the EPrints database
* Write the MD5 to the `checksum.md5` manifest
* Note that the MD5 was generated for the given file in the eprints' digital preservation warnings field

## Preservation Management Screen

An EPrintsArchivematica preservation management screen allows the administrator to browse eprints, including by last exported date, and export status (success or failure - with reason).  For example, an eprint fails the checksum rechecking prior to export  and so is not exported, or is exported with new checksum.

## Preservation Triggers

Plugin configuration file will include a list of metadata elements who's change would flag an eprint as in need of preservation. For example:

$c->{DPExport}= {trigger_fields => [{ meta_fields => [ "title" ] }]}

In addition, the configuration file will include a list of trigger_events that take place on an eprint which flag it as in need of preservation.  For example:

$c->{DPExport}= {trigger_events => [{ events => ["FilesModified"] }]}

It should be possible to configure to flag an item for preservation every time it is moved to "archive" (either from an event or through the appearance of a "datestamp" meta_field).

There should be a command line bin script that will export entire "live" archive dataset, or a list of eprintIDs.

The configuration file should specify if the preservation actions (preservation of eprints flagged as in need of preservation) should be performed in batches or asap (as soon as change occurs):

$c->{DPExport}=>{perform_preservation} = asap|batch

In addition, an option should specify when the batch processing should take place:

$c->{DPExport}=>{perform_preservation_batch} = #use cron time string format to specify time

Batch process all eprints flagged for preservation at the same time each night/week/month/year

## Archivematica Sending Information Back to EPrints

It would be very useful from a management and quality assurance perspective to be able to confirm, in EPrints, that an EPrint was succesfully exported, Archivematica picked up the transfer, and Archivematica successfully created and stored an AIP (Archival Information Package) for the transfer all from the same management screen.   

The Archivematica Storage Service application has in-built functionality to make REST calls to external services following certain actions (e.g. successfully storing an AIP). The Archidora Archivematica-Islandora integration, for example, makes use of this functionality to trigger actions in Islandora following the AIP storage event.  Since a RESTful endpoint is  supported in EPrints, this is the preferred way to send back the following information from Archivematica for each of the processed eprints:

* The UUID of the eprint in Archivematica

The Archivematica Storage Service will send back the AIP transfer folder name, which is the EPrintsArchivemticaDatasetID and the AM UUID using a CRUD callback (http://wiki.eprints.org/w/API:EPrints/Apache/CRUD). 

`curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.eprints.data+xml;" -X PUT --data-binary "@/path/to/data.xml" -u <username>:<password> http://myrepository.org/id/archivematica/<id>`

where `<id>  = EPrintsArchivematicaDatasetID = AIP transfer name`
and `/path/to/data.json` contains the Archivematica UUID of this AIP.
